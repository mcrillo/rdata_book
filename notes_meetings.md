"Analyses of how scientists participate in the process of theory maturation (1) point out that attachment to particular explanations can result in a tendency to overlook inadequacies and contradictions. Such attachment can lead to a reliance on _theory demonstrations_, which selectively sift through data to find supporting evidence. _Theory investigations_, in contrast, have a different motivation: to evaluate the explanatory adequacy and limitations of theories so as to improve them."

Here is a link with some cool extensions to ggplot2 I just found. For the situation Pablo was talking about with needing to make plot grids/facet wraps with very different axis ranges, I have already used ggpubr::ggarrange and cowplot::plot_grid a lot, but it looks like this 'patchwork' package might make it even easier to arrange plots together.
